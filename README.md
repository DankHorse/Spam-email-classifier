# Spam-email-classifier
This project focuses on building an intelligent spam email detection system using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques. The model analyzes email text data, extracts meaningful features using Natural Language Processing (NLP), and classifies messages as Spam or Not Spam (Ham).

The workflow includes data preprocessing, text cleaning, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and performance comparison. Multiple ML algorithms were explored to improve accuracy and generalization. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how ML can be applied to real-world cybersecurity and communication filtering problems.
